1. The messages scroll does not scroll to bottom 
    a. Situation
        i. So far the I don't know why the scroller doesn't scroll to bottom 
        ii. I have the code 
             var div = $('#scroller');
             console.log("Hey I am here, here is div[0].scrollHeight: ", div[0].scrollHeight)
             div.animate({
                scrollTop: 150
             }, 1000);
        iii. However, the scroller does not move. Maybe:
            1. does #scroller not refer to the scroller of id "scroller"?
            2. Maybe I need to set div to the messages or rows or something rather than the outer div?
            3. Why is scroll Height 0?
            4. div.animate does not work
